# Remixed Forms

## Initial Planning

- Forms can be multipart (wizard forms) or single step
- Should allow for multiple input types (text, radio, slider, etc)
- Should allow stateful fields (radio buttons that allow for other options)

### Defining a Form

```js
let form = [
  [
    {
      type: "input",
    },
  ],
];
```
